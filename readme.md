Hi!
I'm `Geming400`. Sorry if my pfp and username is very bad, I found them when I was 6 and I still didn't find a new one...

Currently, I have only 1 public repo which is [progressBar.py](https://github.com/Geming400/progressBar), it's quite bad but I guess it gets the job dones.

But i'm currently making a new project called `gddotpy` which is a lib written in python for geometry dash, this is supposed to be a easier to use version of [gd.py](https://github.com/nekitdev/gd.py) with some feature not in it *(this isn't a fork)*
This lib is and will be my biggest project yet for me. Also as this is will be on **pip** and my first lib, I hope I will do it well!

Published projects:
- [progressBar.py](https://github.com/Geming400/progressBar)

WIP projects:
- `gddotpy`
